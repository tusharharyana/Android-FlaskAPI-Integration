# Customer's Credit Rating Prediction Android application using flask API deployed on PythonAnywhere.
Introducing our Customer's Credit Rating Prediction Android application powered by a Flask API deployed on PythonAnywhere. This application leverages machine learning to provide accurate credit rating predictions for customers. With seamless integration between the Android app and the Flask API, users can conveniently access credit ratings on the go.

- To deploy your machine learning model, start by setting up Flask on `https://www.pythonanywhere.com/`.
- Create a Flask web application and define routes to handle model predictions.
- Upload your trained machine learning model to the server and load it within your Flask app.
- Configure your Flask app to process incoming requests and provide predictions by integrating Postman for testing and validation.
- Test your deployed model by sending sample data to the Flask endpoint and verifying the predictions.
- Once satisfied with the deployment, make sure to monitor the performance of your application and handle any potential issues.

- Note: I have already created a repository detailing how to create a Flask API and deploy it on PythonAnywhere. You can find it at `https://github.com/tusharharyana/Ml-Model-Flask-API`.
